A Fun Sliding Block Game

Is a fun game that I made where you have to navigate a big red block through a bunch of smaller blocks so it can reach the exit. It is very reminiscent of the game traffic rush, but the blocks can move in any direction.

To play click on a block and click on the arrows to move them arround. Try to move the big red block out of the bottom middle.
